== Changes from 2.0.x to 3.0.x ==

=== XML compatibility ===

* 3.0 now support xml 1.1 cleanly (is aware of differences between 1.0,
  uses separate well-formedness checks where necessary)
* XML conformance significantly improved, to pass XMLTest test suite
  (with 99%+ pass rate).

=== Packaging ===

* EscapingWriterFactory moved from main org.codehaus.stax2 package
  to the new org.codehaus.stax.io sub-package.

=== Stream reader ===

* Default setting for P_REPORT_PROLOG_WHITESPACE is
  now Boolean.TRUE (instead of Boolean.FALSE), to emulate behaviour
  of the StAX reference implementation, and to keep output in pass-through
  configurations more similar to input.
* Handling of undeclared entities changed so that no exception is thrown
  in non-expanding mode; this is similar to the way ref. impl. works.
* isCharacters() now only returns true if current event is CHARACTERS,
  instead of CHARACTERS, CDATA and SPACE (as in 1.0 and 2.0). Change was
  done for interoperatibility -- the StAX reference implementation
  behaves like 3.0.
* Removed property P_TEXT_BUFFER_LENGTH, since there is no real benefit
  from changing this setting -- text buffer is resized dynamically as
  needed, and initial value is largely irrelevant.

=== Stream writer ===

* In 2.0.x most well-formedness checks (P_CHECK_xxx) resulted in
  unchecked IllegalStateException. Due to requests by developers, who
  found this unintuitive, these were replaced by checked XMLStreamExceptions.
* In 2.0.x, WstxOutputProperties.P_OUTPUT_VALIDATE_CONTENT was false
  by default: in 3.0 it is true. Change was due to more efficient checking
  of the content, made possible by integrated transcoding. As such, it seems
  useful to have more rigorous checks enabled by default. Also, since
  WstxOutputProperties.P_OUTPUT_FIX_CONTENT was and is true by default,
  CDATA and COMMENT sections will be automatically "fixed" now.

=== Event reader ===

* Event readers are now constructed so that P_LAZY_PARSING is always
  disabled (to get accurate XMLStreamExceptions instead of possible
  runtime exceptions, with no performance difference).
  Also, P_MIN_TEXT_SEGMENT will be set to maximum value, to avoid
  ever splitting a CHARACTERS or CDATA segment (to minimize number
  of event objects created).
